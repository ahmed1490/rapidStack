Ports (General applications)
80 : HTTP [ Generally Port 80 is filtered to allow only HTTP ]
443 : HTTPS [ HTTPS data is encrypted to something can be sent inside https ]
22 : SSH [On port 22 generally protocols are not checked]

Server has : 
VNC Terminal : Port 22 
Flash Policy Server : Port 443
Port 80 was tried but later changed, coz statistically Traffic check (non-http traffics are filtered) on 80 are done more than on port 22.

BS uses flash to communicate to VNC Terminal on Server with its own protocol "Flash Socket Server (chk)" which runs on 
Flash Policy Server is needed to validate and allow incoming Flash connection

Kaazing [unstable] is used as proxy to convert diff (including flash service-chk) backend services to normal HTTP/(S) traffic. We use Https.
But this seems to not work ever time.

Research
Socket.io can use socket for VNC on some port. 
noVNC provides js VNC Client for use of sockets. It uses socket.io internally
Blocks
Firewall : eg: check for only http and https on 80 and 443 respectively
Proxies : Squid?
